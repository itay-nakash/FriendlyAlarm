# FriendlyAlarm
An alarm clock app that I bulid to practice java and app development.


This app is a fully function alarm clock, with multible alarms to choose from, different songs to choose as the alarm sounds
and fully desiged user interface.

This was my first big project, and was build mainy for improving my coding skill and knowlege as an android developer.

Here some pictures from different stages of this app development:

# Reasoning:
I planed to make this "Friendly Alarm" in term of friends collabirate alarm clock.
The idea was to create shared alarms for friends, after I saw that my group of friends had problems with times.
To ensure that your friends really do put alrams for tomarrow morning ay 7am when they said they will- put the alarm "with them".
finally, I skipped this feature from time reasons.
